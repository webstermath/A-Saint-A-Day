A Saint A Day

## Todo
- Finish recording track times in spreadsheet
- Make offline first
- Make github repo public

## End Goal
1. Track Tools
- Build better track tools for collaboration and capture
- analyze sound volume and use auto-dictation that matches times with text to predict break points
- push results to database
2. Track API
- create a public API to fetch track objects from database (Firebase)
- should be usable in multiple apps, web pages, podcat apps, etc.
3. Player App
- app should allows user to choose a book/recording
- choice will contain app style and feature customizations (images, text, etc.)
- app will then fetch track object from database using API
